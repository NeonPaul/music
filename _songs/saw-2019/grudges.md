If I die I'll become a ghost
(I should have learned this a long long time ago)
I'll become a warning to the past
(Thought I learned this a long long time ago)
In the summer things are gonna change
(Pretty sure I have somewhere to be)
Somehow different but always somehow the same
(Pretty sure I saw this all in a dream)

We're on a planet that's practically a sphere
(I should have learned this a long long time ago)
The same flowers the same time each year
(Thought I learned this a long long time ago)
In the winter things are gonna change
(Pretty sure I have somewhere to be)
Somehow different but somehow always the same
(Pretty sure I saw this all in a dream)

I'm feeling old, I'm feeling older
I'm missing all the present
Too many grudges to hold on to
