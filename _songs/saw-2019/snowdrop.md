It's a long cold night but it's
Warm in the kitchen
Glass thick with condensate
Shows me your reflection
And my whole world is here

Wrapped up in warm air,
Sung to by the smells
Rich and reviving
Put under their spell
It's a long cold night out there

And crack a window
Crisp and refreshing air
Pouring from the snowscape
An empty world is there

I'm suspended from the cold
Hanging from a snowdrop with you
Singing joy, joy
Joy
