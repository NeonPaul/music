Hello once again I have been waiting for my friends
You always pick me up when I've been down
You believe in me and say it's plenty just to be
And to be anything as long as it's around

Hey good afternoon I shall be going to the moon
Does anybody want to hitch a ride?
I haven't got a rocket and I hope that doesn't stop it
But if so we can just spend the day inside
